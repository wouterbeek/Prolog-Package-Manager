A very simple package manager for SWI-Prolog.

Prolog Package Manager makes it easy to install Prolog code by using
the Github service.

* Installing PPM

  1. Install a recent version of [[http://www.swi-prolog][SWI-Prolog]].
  2. Run SWI-Prolog and use the built-in package manager to install
     PPM: ~pack_install('git://github.com/wouterbeek/ppm').~

* Installing a package with PPM

Suppose you want to install package ~foo~ from user ~bar~, published
at https://github.com/foo/bar:

  1. Run SWI-Prolog and load PPM: ~[library(ppm)].~
  2. Run ~ppm_install(bar, foo).~

Call the following to verify that the package was installed
successfully: ~ppm_list.~

* Publish a package through PPM

Here is an example for user ~foo~ who publishes a package called
~bar~:

  1. Develop the package locally in a Git-controlled directory called
     ~${home}/lib/swipl/pack/bar~.

  2. The direcotry /must/ have a file called ~ppm.json~ which must
     specify any dependencies.  For example:

     #+BEGIN_SRC json
     {"dependencies": [
       {"user": "wouterbeek", "repo": "Prolog-Library-Collection"}
     ]}
     #+END_SRC

  3. Run SWI-Prolog and load PPM: ~[library(ppm)].~

  4. Publish a version of your package with the following call:
     ~ppm_publish(bar, version(0,1,0)).~
